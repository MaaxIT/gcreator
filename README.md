# GCreator
A script automatically creating a Garry's Mod addon base

To use it, just double-click the **gcreator.cmd** file.  
This script will open a powershell page and ask you for details about your addon.

This script is automatically updated so you don't need to come and download it every commit.  
In order to bypass the powershell execution policies, the script is hosted on a secured website. The code is still open-source, just use the link to see it.
You can see the remote powershell script in **remote/gcreator.ps1** too but it's may not be the last version.
