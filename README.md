# GCreator
A script automatically creating a Garry's Mod addon base

To use it, just double-click the **gcreator.cmd** file.  
This script will open a powershell page and ask you for details about your addon.

This script is automatically updated so you don't need to come and download it every commit.  
You can see the remote powershell script in **remote/gcreator.ps1** but it's may not be the last version.
